# Code-Graph-RAG

Code-Graph-RAG parses a multi-language codebase with Tree-sitter, builds a knowledge graph of its structure in Memgraph, and lets you query, edit, and optimise that code in plain English. It works across a monorepo of mixed languages under one unified graph schema.

## BuildProof Web Console

BuildProof is the product-facing system-analysis console for agent-generated
applications. It automatically maps Web pages to frontend requests and backend
routes, groups APIs into business domains, and links every conclusion to source
evidence — no Cypher required.

```bash
uv run buildproof --repo /path/to/agent-built-app
```

Then open `http://127.0.0.1:8765`. See the
[BuildProof guide](docs/guide/buildproof.md) for Docker deployment and API use.

## Latest News 🔥

<!-- SECTION:latest_news -->
- **Java Taint Improvements**: Enhanced taint tracking in Java, including handling JDK shims, chained call receivers, literal arguments, and type-test patterns.
- **C# Taint Propagation**: Improved taint propagation in C# with refinements to argument binding, tuple deconstruction, and await plumbing methods.
- **Semantic Frontend Enhancements**: Added in-process Jedi semantic frontend for Python and re-run semantic frontends on the watch path for more accurate analysis.
- **Protocol Buffer Indexing**: Introduced a canonical protobuf index with provenance manifest and a verify command for improved data integrity.
- **Structural Analysis**: Added structural snapshot diffs between protobuf indexes and structural ast-grep support for seven additional languages.

## What It Does

Point Code-Graph-RAG at a repository and it reads every source file, extracts functions, classes, methods, modules, and the relationships between them, and stores the result as an interconnected graph. Once the graph exists you can:

- Ask questions about the codebase in natural language and get answers grounded in the real structure.
- Retrieve the actual source of any function, class, or method by name or by intent.
- Edit code through the agent with AST-based surgical patching and a diff preview before anything changes.
- Optimise code against language best practices or your own coding standards.
- Find dead code by walking call and reference edges from entry points.
- Search and rewrite structurally by AST pattern with ast-grep.
- Overlay runtime behaviour: trace a test run (or pull production eBPF profiles) with `cgr trace` and merge the calls that actually happened into the graph, exposing dispatch that static analysis cannot see.

## How It Works

The system has two components:

1. **Multi-language parser.** A Tree-sitter based parser reads the codebase and ingests functions, classes, methods, modules, and their relationships into Memgraph under a single language-agnostic schema.
2. **RAG system** (`codebase_rag/`). An interactive CLI that turns natural language into Cypher queries, retrieves matching code, and drives AI-powered editing and optimisation.

```
Source Code -> Tree-sitter Parser -> AST Analysis -> Memgraph Knowledge Graph
                                                             |
User Query -> AI Model (Cypher Gen) -> Cypher Query -> Graph Results -> Response
```

See the [Architecture Overview](docs/architecture/overview.md) and [Graph Schema](docs/architecture/graph-schema.md) for the full picture.

## Supported Languages

Python, TypeScript, TSX, JavaScript, Rust, Go, Java, C, C++, C#, PHP, Lua, and Dart are fully supported. Scala is in development, and Ruby, Kotlin, Swift, Elixir, Haskell, Solidity, Bash, and Nix have structural support (modules, functions, classes where the language has them, and imports) through the pluggable ast-grep tier. See the [Language Support](docs/architecture/language-support.md) matrix for per-language capabilities.

## Installation

`cgr` is published to PyPI. Install it system-wide with the `treesitter-full` (all languages) and `semantic` (vector search) extras:

```bash
# with uv (recommended)
uv tool install "code-graph-rag[treesitter-full,semantic]"

# or with pipx
pipx install "code-graph-rag[treesitter-full,semantic]"
```

### Which version am I getting?

Three version lines exist and they intentionally differ:

| where | what it tracks |
|---|---|
| git tags | every version, one per merge |
| GitHub Releases (binaries, signatures) | every 50th version, plus any security fix |
| PyPI | every 50th version, plus any security fix |

So the newest tag on `main` usually runs ahead of the newest release, often by
tens of patch versions; they coincide only just after a release. Nothing is
stuck, the cadences differ by design. A security fix does NOT wait for the
cadence: it ships a release and a PyPI upload immediately.

`uv tool install` and `pipx install` give you the newest PyPI version, which is the
newest RELEASE, not the newest tag. Interim tags exist so every merge is
addressable; binaries and PyPI uploads follow the cadence above.

To run code newer than the latest release, install from git:

```bash
uv tool install "code-graph-rag[treesitter-full,semantic] @ git+https://github.com/vitali87/code-graph-rag@main"
```

You also need Docker (for Memgraph), `cmake`, and `ripgrep`. Full prerequisites, source installs, and environment setup are in the [Installation](docs/getting-started/installation.md) guide.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Start the packaged Memgraph + Qdrant stack (no compose file needed)
cgr daemon up

# Parse a repository into the graph, then query it
cgr start --repo-path /path/to/repo --update-graph
cgr start --repo-path /path/to/repo
```

Repeat the first command for each repository you want indexed; the graph is
shared, and syncing one project leaves the others alone. To start over from an
empty graph, add `--clean` — it deletes **every** project in the shared graph,
not just this one, and asks for confirmation first when other
projects would be destroyed.

The [Quick Start](docs/getting-started/quickstart.md) guide walks through parsing, querying, and exporting in five minutes.

## MCP Server

Code-Graph-RAG runs as an [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server so Claude Code and other MCP clients can query and edit your codebase directly. See the [MCP Server](docs/guide/mcp-server.md) guide for setup.
